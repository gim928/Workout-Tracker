## Description

This web application allows me to be able to view, create, and track daily workouts. The user can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. The user can also track the name, type, weight, sets, rets, and duration of exercise. If an exercise is a cardio type of exercise, the user can track their distance traveled. This app is designed to allow a user to reach their fitness goals by keeping track of their workout progress.
